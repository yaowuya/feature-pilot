## FeaturePilot workspace and information layer

Before choosing output paths, commands, UI/backend rules, or workflow behavior:

1. Treat the target project repository root as the FeaturePilot project root, and look only for `fp-docs/` directly under that root.
2. If `fp-docs/manifest.md` exists, read it first.
3. Read only relevant settings and intel listed by the manifest.
4. If UI/frontend is involved and `fp-docs/settings/frontend.md` exists, read it as a required source.
5. If backend/API/data/security behavior is involved and `fp-docs/settings/backend.md` exists, read it as a required source.
6. Treat settings/intel as navigation and constraints; verify exact implementation facts against current code.
7. Use two precedence modes: current code/command output wins for current-state facts; approved change artifacts win for target-state requirements.

Public plugin rule: do not hardcode any customer component library, vendor, component prefix, design token, backend framework, API envelope, or workflow policy in public skills. Customer-specific rules belong in target-project settings.

Compatibility rule: if the project root has no `fp-docs/manifest.md`, continue from current code and existing settings when safe, recommend `/fp-init`, and do not force initialization. If the current phase must write FeaturePilot artifacts, create only the necessary artifact directories under the project-root `fp-docs/`; do not create manifest/settings/intel except through `/fp-init`.


Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until
we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design
tree resolving dependencies between decisions one by one.

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore
the codebase instead.

For each question, provide your recommended answer.
